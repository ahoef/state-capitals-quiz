=====================

a work-in-progress simple javascript calculator


Creating this calculator was a practice exercise in JavaScript, guided by a tutorial on Codeacademy. Currently it doesn't take decimal numbers as inputs, and in a single operation, the value of only two integers can be calculated. Also, it does not yet display rounded decimals or take keyboard inputs. These features will be coming soon!

The calculator's design and coded styles are my originals.
